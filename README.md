# Jared Tobias - Binary Search Tree Lab
For ToDo #1 I completed method doInOrder.

For ToDo #2 I completed preOrderTraversal() by creating and completing a new private method doPreOrder().

For ToDo #3 I found the height of a tree by creating a method named calculateHeight() which findHeight() calls that method.

For ToDo #4 I found the depth by creating a method calculateDepth() which getDepth() calls that method.

For ToDo #5 I fixed the second line of print() so it calls a new method printTree() that prints up the binary tree using "| __"
